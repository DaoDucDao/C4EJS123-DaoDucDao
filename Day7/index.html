                <hr>
                <p>A bridge with overhead cables supporting its roadway. 
                    Modern suspension bridges are light and aesthetically 
                    pleasing and can span longer distances than any other 
                    bridge form. They are also among the most expensive 
                    bridges to construct. Though suspension bridges can be 
                    made strong enough to support freight trains, they have 
                    nearly all been designed for automobile traffic.</p>

                <h3> Cable Stayed Bridge </h3>
                <hr>
                <p>A cable-stayed bridge has one or more towers (or pylons), 
                    from which cables support the bridge deck. A distinctive 
                    feature are the cables or stays, which run directly from 
                    the tower to the deck, normally forming a fan-like pattern 
                    or a series of parallel lines. This is in contrast to the 
                    modern suspension bridge, where the cables supporting the 
                    deck are suspended vertically from the main cable, anchored 
                    at both ends of the bridge and running between the towers. 
                    The cable-stayed bridge is optimal for spans longer than 
                    cantilever bridges and shorter than suspension bridges. 
                    This is the range within which cantilever bridges would 
                    rapidly grow heavier, and suspension bridge cabling would be 
                    more costly.</p>

                <h3> Arch Bridge </h3>
                <hr>
                <p>An arch bridge is a bridge with abutments at each end shaped
                    as a curved arch. Arch bridges work by transferring the 
                    weight of the bridge and its loads partially into a horizontal
                    thrust restrained by the abutments at either side. A viaduct 
                    (a long bridge) may be made from a series of arches, although 
                    other more economical structures are typically used today.</p>

                <h3> Hybrid Cable-Stayed Suspension Bridge </h3>
                <p>A cable-stayed suspension hybrid bridge has become a
                    popular type of bridges throughout the world because of
                    its aesthetic shape, structural efficiency, and economical
                    construction.
                    As the modern day demands put forward greater
                    challenges for the construction of longer spans or taller
                    structures, the better solution is possible by using high
                    strength steel cable systems as cable supported bridges
                    like suspended stayed or hybrid, roofs supported on
                    cables, trusses, nets, antenna</p>

                <hr>
                <p>As the name implies, a steel bridge is a bridge in which 
                    the main material is steel. Steel bridge members are easy 
                    to fabricate and are widely used in bridge construction due 
                    to the high tensile strength of steel materials. ... 
                    Moreover, steel bridges do not undergo dry shrinkage or creep 
                    as loads are applied over time.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>A beam or "girder" bridge is the simplest and most 
                    inexpensive kind of bridge. ... In its most basic form, 
                    a beam bridge consists of a horizontal beam that is 
                    supported at each end by piers. The weight of the beam 
                    pushes straight down on the piers.</p>
