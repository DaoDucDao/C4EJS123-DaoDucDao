/* 1.a)
- var and const are two other variables declaration
1.b)
- var is a global scope, let is a local scope 
If var is declared, it can be used by any block scope (because it's global), while let is only used and declared inside of {}
- var can be redeclared, while let can not (let variables can only updated)
1.c)
- let can be updated, while const can not (const = constance)
const variables are set as read-only types
1.d)
- All of them are used to declared variables
- But var is not as common as let and const since 2016 because it has so many problems and can be buggy
- We use let and const instead. let is normally used for every variables declaration. When it come to the variables that we dont want
to accidentally change it, we use const to set the value to read-only type.

 /*
 2)
 - The boolean datatype helps us to manipulate the condition
 - It represent two types of values: True/False
 - Convert to Boolean: 
 result = Boolean (<value>);
